Line 6:  More code commentary for the next line of code.
Line 7:  This line uses the Nslookup command to get the ip address of the domain name of the site site entered by the user.  This information is then filtered by the grep command to only extract the ip address from the nslookup command results using a regular expression.  This is then stored as the variable Ip_address 
Line 8: Blank
Line 9: More code commentary for the next two lines of code
Line 10:  This line uses the whois command to extract information about the domain registrar and the expiration date.  This information is piped to the grep command which extracts the information from this command using a regular expression to make it not case sensitive.  The output then is piped to the awk command to split the output using the : to extract the second field which contains the registrar information.  The Tr command is then used to remove any leading or trailing characters and then store that information in the Registar variable.
Line 11:  Is pretty much the same command as line 10 but instead of grabbing the registrar information  it grabs the expiration date of the website instead  and stores it as the variable experation_date
